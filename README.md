# Depreciation Notice
This software was developed to allow clip players for twitch.tv to continue functioning, but API updates have made this no longer neccessary.
If you're here looking for a solution for clip mp4 urls, you can use the [twitch clips consent api](https://github.com/sugoidogo/twitch-clips-consent-api)
